                Hello there! I am Swastideepa Dash, from Bhubaneswar.
                Currently I am pursuing my Bachelor's of technology degree in the department of Computer science and engineering.
                I have completed my matriculation and intermediate from the Venkateswar English Medium School, Bhubaneswar.
                I am from a nuclear family, which consists of my father, mother, sister and me.
                My father is a proffessor in a management college in Bhubaneswar, my mom is a home maker and my sister reads in class 9th.
                My aim is to go into the management lines and persue MBA. My strength includes leadership and management skills. 
                I am also the class representative of my class.

        <p class="interest">
            My interest includes Photography. I like capturing nature and its beauty.
            I also like pencil sketching in my free time. Although I am not a proffessional, I have some raw pieces. 
            Let me show you:
